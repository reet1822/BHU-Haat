# BHU-Haat.io
	
This is a platform for the students of BHU to make the process of selling and buying easy amongst themselves. Often people need to buy things, and at the same time others want to purchase the same item. This site will help such people find each other. 
	
The exchange doesn't need to be monatory each time. The platform serves as a 'Lost and Found' platform as well. 

The task is accomplished by serving the data of Lost items to people who have lost something and the same for sell and purchase as well.

All the bugs, further ideas related to the project are most welcomed.

;)
